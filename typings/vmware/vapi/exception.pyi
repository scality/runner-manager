    This exception is raised by various components of the vAPI runtime
    infrastructure to indicate failures in that infrastructure.

    Server-side the exception is caught by specific components and an
    internal_server_error is reported to the client that invoked the
    request.  Client-side the exception may be raised for certain failures
    before a request was sent to the server or after the response was
    received from the server.  Similarly, server-side the exception may
    be raised for failures that occur when a provider implementation
    invokes the vAPI runtime.

    This exception is not part of the vAPI message protocol, and it must
    never be raised by provider implementations.
