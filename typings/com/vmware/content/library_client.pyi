    """
    The ``ItemModel`` class represents a library item that has been stored in a
    library.

    A ``ItemModel`` represents a single logical unit to be managed within a
    :class:`com.vmware.content_client.LibraryModel`. Items contain the actual
    content of a library, and their placement within a library determines
    policies that affect that content such as publishing.

    A library item can have a specified type, indicated with the
    :attr:`ItemModel.type` attribute. This property is associated with a
    Content Library Service plugin that supports specific types and provides
    additional services. The types available in a specific Content Library
    Service can be queried using the :class:`com.vmware.content_client.Type`
    class. Items of an unknown or unspecified type are treated generically.
    Because subscribed library catalogs are synchronized as is, subscribing to
    a remote Content Library Service effectively gives you a library with the
    functionality of the remote service's type adapter plugins, even if they
    are not installed locally.

    Items can be managed using the :class:`Item` class and, for items in
    subscribed libraries, the :class:`SubscribedItem` class.

            item. Changes to name, description, and so on will increment this
            value. The value is not incremented by changes to the content or
            tags of the item or the library which owns it.

            used on the storage backing for all the files in the item. When the
            library item is not cached, the size is 0.
            This attribute is not used for the ``create`` method. It is
            optional in the return value of the ``get`` or ``list`` methods. It
            is not used for the ``update`` method.
        :type  type: :class:`str`
        :param type: An optional type identifier which indicates the type adapter plugin
            to use.

            This attribute may be set to a non-empty string value that
            corresponds to an identifier supported by a type adapter plugin
            present in the Content Library Service. A type adapter plugin, if
            present for the specified type, can provide additional information
            and services around the item content. A type adapter can guide the
            upload process by creating file entries that are in need of being
            uploaded to complete an item.

            The types and plugins supported by the Content Library Service can
            be queried using the :class:`com.vmware.content_client.Type` class.
            This attribute is optional for the ``create`` and ``update``
            methods. During creation, if the type is left unspecified, or if
            the type is specified but does not have a corresponding type
            support plugin, then the type of the library item is considered to
            be generic and all data is treated as generic files. During update,
            if the type is not specified, then it is not updated.
        :type  version: :class:`str`
        :param version: A version number that is updated on metadata changes. This value is
            used to validate update requests to provide optimistic concurrency
            of changes.

            This value represents a number that is incremented every time
            library item properties, such as name or description, are changed.
            It is not incremented by changes to the file content of the library
            item, including adding or removing files. It is also not affected
            by tagging the library item.
            This attribute is not used for the ``create`` method. It will
            always be present in the result of a ``get`` or ``list`` method. It
            is optional for the ``update`` method. Leaving it None during
            update indicates that you do not need to detect concurrent updates.
        :type  source_id: :class:`str`
        :param source_id: The identifier of the :class:`ItemModel` to which this item is
            synchronized to if the item belongs to a subscribed library. The
            value is None for a library item that belongs to a local library.
            When clients pass a value of this class as a parameter, the
            attribute must be an identifier for the resource type:
            ``com.vmware.content.library.Item``. When methods return a value of
            this class as a return value, the attribute will be an identifier
            for the resource type: ``com.vmware.content.library.Item``.
            This attribute is not used for the ``create`` method. It is
            optional in the return value of the ``get`` or ``list`` methods. It
            is not used for the ``update`` method.

            This attribute is not used for the ``create`` and ``update``
            methods. It will be present in the result of a ``get`` or ``list``
