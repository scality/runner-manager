# Local Setup

A docker-compose file has been created to help you run the required components for the openstack-actions-runner.

To install `docker-compose` run:
```shell
pip install docker-compose
```

## Ngrok setup

As the openstack-actions-runner depends on webhook to work properly.

Ngrok can help you setup a public url to be used with GitHub webhooks.

Create an account on ngrok.com and configure ngrok on your laptop following the doc on the website.

## Credentials

Considering you have followed the instruction on the [config](config.md) section. Create a `.env` file, and set the following vars:
```bash
CLOUD_NINE_USERNAME=your.username
CLOUD_NINE_TOKEN=your.token
GITHUB_TOKEN=your.github.token
```

## Settings

Create a settings.yaml file like the following:
```
cp config_example.yml test_settings.yml
```

You can keep most of the settings there, but you should change the following:

GitHub org and OpenStack configs
```yaml
# Your github organization where you want to attach your self-hosted runners
github_organization:

# Cloud nine connection infos
cloud_nine_region: "Region"
cloud_nine_tenant: "tenant.name"
```

Create a runner pool with the desired specs
```yaml
runner_pool:
  - flavor: 'm1.small'
    image: 'bionic-server-cloudimg-amd64_20181011.qcow2'
    quantity:
      min: 2
      max: 10
    tags:
      - bionic
      - small
# To ease up testing on this specific pool of runner
# Add a very unique tag so that you can select, precisely, your runner
      - myspecifictag
```

## Run

Once the configuration has been set you can boot your docker-compose file like the following:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

And on the side you can run ngrok to create a public url for you to work with webhooks.

```
ngrok http 8080
```

## Webhook setup

Setup a webhook at the organization level, should be on a link like the following
`https://github.com/organizations/<your org>/settings/hooks`

* Click on Add Webhook
* In payload url, enter your ngrok url, like the following:
`https://ngrok.url/webhook`
* Content type: application/json
* Click on `Let me select individual events.`
* Select: `Workflow jobs` and `Workflow runs`


## Setting up your testing repo

Create a new repository in the organization you have configured the openstack actions runner.

And push the following workflow in the repository:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-self-hosted.yaml
---
name: test-self-hosted
on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  greet:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        person:
        - foo
        - bar
    runs-on:
    - self-hosted
    - myspecifictag # here you ensure that your specific runner will be called
    steps:
    - name: sleep
      run: sleep 120
    - name: Send greeting
      run: echo "Hello ${{ matrix.person }}!"
```

Trigger builds and enjoy :beers:
